```

#### **Fix A4: Mode Selection Issues**
```
MODE SELECTION GUIDE:
‚úÖ THEME PRESERVE: 1 stylistic image, focus on artistic style
‚úÖ MULTI-VIEW FUSION: 2+ images of same object, focus on accuracy

QUICK TEST:
Try the other fusion mode and compare results!
```

### **Advanced Quality Diagnostics:**
If basic fixes don't work:

1. **Try Progressive Refinement:**
   ```
   Start: "side view of the same car"
   Add detail: "side profile view of the same red car"  
   Add style: "side profile view of the same red car, professional photography"
   ```

2. **Test with Different Reference:**
   - Use only your highest quality reference image
   - Try a completely different reference photo

3. **Check Prompt Structure:**
   - Does it include specific viewpoint?
   - Does it include "same [subject]"?
   - Does it include style preservation terms?

```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. ‚úÖ Be more specific about direction:
   ‚ùå "from the side" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "from the left side profile"
   ‚ùå "from above" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "aerial view from directly overhead"

2. ‚úÖ Add supporting context:
   "showing the [specific feature]", "view that reveals [hidden element]"

3. ‚úÖ Use photography terminology:
   "low angle shot", "high angle perspective", "three-quarter view"

DIRECTIONAL VOCABULARY:
- Horizontal: "left side", "right side", "front", "back", "three-quarter"
- Vertical: "from above", "from below", "eye level", "overhead", "ground level"  
- Distance: "close-up", "wide shot", "macro detail", "establishing shot"
```

#### **Fix B3: Subtle Changes Not Working**
```
FOR SUBTLE VIEWPOINT CHANGES:
1. ‚úÖ Use Theme Preserve mode
2. ‚úÖ Increase preservation language:
   "same exact car but slight side angle"
   "same composition but rotated 30 degrees"
   
3. ‚úÖ Add continuity terms:
   "maintaining all details", "preserving every element"

PROMPT TEMPLATE:
"[SUBTLE CHANGE] of the same [DETAILED SUBJECT], maintaining [SPECIFIC ELEMENTS], same [STYLE ASPECTS]"
```

#### **Fix B4: Object Identity Not Preserved**
```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. ‚úÖ Switch to Multi-View Fusion mode
2. ‚úÖ Use very specific object description:
   ‚ùå "same car" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "same red BMW M3 sedan"
   ‚ùå "same building" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "same modern glass office tower"

3. ‚úÖ Add identity preservation terms:
   "identical [object]", "exact same [subject]", "preserving all original features"

4. ‚úÖ Provide multiple reference angles if available

IDENTITY PRESERVATION TEMPLATE:
"[VIEWPOINT] of the identical [SPECIFIC SUBJECT WITH DETAILS], preserving all original [KEY FEATURES], same [DISTINCTIVE ELEMENTS]"
```

### **Content Optimization:**
If content is working but could be better:

1. **Refine Specificity:**
   - Add more descriptive terms for the subject
   - Include specific features to preserve
   - Mention exact viewpoint angle

2. **Test Variations:**
   - Try different viewpoint descriptions
   - Test both fusion modes
   - Experiment with prompt length
