# 🎯 Complete User Guide: How to Get Perfect Results from Image Fusion

## 📋 **Quick Start Checklist**

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- ✅ **High-quality reference images** (512x512+ resolution, sharp, well-lit)
- ✅ **Clear prompt** specifying the exact viewpoint you want
- ✅ **Correct mode selected** (Theme Preserve vs Multi-View Fusion)
- ✅ **Consistent lighting** across all reference images

---

## 🎨 **Understanding the Two Fusion Modes**

### **🎭 Theme Preserve Mode**
**Best for:** Artistic style preservation, mood transfer, creative photography
**When to use:** Single stylistic reference image, focus on atmosphere/mood
**Strengths:** Excellent style consistency, artistic interpretation, mood preservation

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Same mystical forest atmosphere but from ground level"
- "Same dramatic portrait lighting but profile view"
- "Same vintage photography style but different composition"
- "Same moody sunset atmosphere but aerial perspective"

### **🔄 Multi-View Fusion Mode**
**Best for:** Object documentation, product photography, architectural views
**When to use:** 2+ reference images of same subject, focus on accuracy
**Strengths:** Precise object preservation, accurate viewpoint transformation

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Side view of the same red BMW from my references"
- "Aerial view of the same office building"
- "Back view of the same smartphone model"
- "Interior view of the same room layout"

## 🧪 **Testing and Troubleshooting**

### **📊 Quality Check Process**

#### **Step 1: Basic Test**
1. Upload your reference image(s)
2. Enter: `"side view of the same [object]"`
3. Generate and evaluate results

#### **Step 2: Check Results**
```
✅ SUCCESS INDICATORS:
- Requested viewpoint is clearly shown
- Colors and style match reference
- Object identity is preserved
- Quality is professional

❌ PROBLEM INDICATORS:
- Output too similar to reference
- Style/colors don't match
- Object changes too much
- Poor quality/artifacts
```

#### **Step 3: Refinement**
Based on results, adjust your approach:

### **🔧 Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue: "Output looks exactly like my reference"**
```
💡 SOLUTIONS:
- Use more specific viewpoint terms ("45-degree side angle" vs "side view")
- Increase transformation strength
- Try Multi-View Fusion if using Theme Preserve
- Add "completely different angle" to prompt
```

#### **Issue: "Output doesn't preserve my reference style"**
```
💡 SOLUTIONS:
- Switch to Theme Preserve mode
- Add "same style, same colors, same lighting" to prompt
- Use higher quality reference images
- Ensure reference images have consistent style
```

#### **Issue: "Object changes too much/becomes unrecognizable"**
```
💡 SOLUTIONS:
- Switch to Multi-View Fusion mode
- Use "same [specific object]" language
- Provide multiple reference angles
- Add preservation terms ("identical [object]")
```

#### **Issue: "Poor quality or artifacts in output"**
```
💡 SOLUTIONS:
- Use higher resolution reference images (1024x1024+)
- Ensure reference images are sharp and well-lit
- Try different prompt wording
- Check reference image consistency
```

### **🎯 Progressive Refinement Strategy**

#### **Start Simple:**
```
"side view of the same red car"
```

#### **Add Specificity:**
```
"side profile view of the same red sports car showing the wheels clearly"
```

#### **Enhance Quality:**
```
"side profile view of the same red sports car, same parking lot background, professional automotive photography, high detail"
```

#### **Perfect Result:**
```
"side profile view of the same red BMW M3, same concrete parking lot background, same dramatic golden hour lighting, professional automotive photography, high detail, cinematic quality"
```

## 🏆 **Pro Tips for Exceptional Results**

### **1. 📸 Reference Image Strategy**
```
• Single Image: Choose your highest quality, most representative shot
• 2-3 Images: Ensure same subject, vary angles moderately
• 4+ Images: Excellent for Multi-View, check lighting consistency
• Mixed Quality: Use your best image first, others as support
```

### **2. 🎯 Prompt Optimization**
```
• Be specific about direction: "from the left side" vs "side view"
• Include preservation terms: "same lighting, same colors"
• Add quality terms: "professional photography, high detail"
• Specify completeness: "full car visible" vs "close-up detail"
```

### **3. ⚡ Mode Selection Logic**
```
Single reference + artistic focus = Theme Preserve
Multiple references + accuracy focus = Multi-View Fusion
Unsure? Try Theme Preserve first, then Multi-View if needed
```

### **4. 🔄 Iterative Improvement**
```
1. Start with basic prompt
2. Evaluate result quality
3. Identify specific issues
4. Refine prompt or change mode
5. Test again with improvements
```

### **5. 📝 Prompt Templates**

#### **Basic Template:**
```
"[VIEWPOINT] of the same [SPECIFIC SUBJECT], same [STYLE ELEMENTS]"
```

#### **Advanced Template:**
```
"[SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT] of the same [DETAILED SUBJECT], same [LIGHTING/BACKGROUND], [PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE], [QUALITY TERMS]"
```

#### **Example Applications:**
```
