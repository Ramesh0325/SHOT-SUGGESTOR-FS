## 📋 **Pre-Flight Checklist**
```
□ Reference images are sharp and well-lit (512x512+ resolution)

□ Prompt includes "same [subject]" preservation language
□ Correct fusion mode selected for your goal
```

## 🎯 **Mode Selection (30-Second Decision)**

### **🎭 Use Theme Preserve If:**
- ✅ 1 artistic/stylistic reference image
- ✅ Style/mood preservation is priority
- ✅ Creative/artistic content
- ✅ "Make it look like this style but from different angle"

### **🔄 Use Multi-View Fusion If:**
- ✅ 2+ reference images of same object
- ✅ Object accuracy is priority  
- ✅ Technical/commercial content
- ✅ "Show me this exact thing from different side"

---

## ✍️ **Prompt Formula That Always Works**

```
[SPECIFIC VIEWPOINT] + "of the same" + [EXACT SUBJECT] + "same [STYLE ELEMENTS]"
```

### **Examples:**
```
✅ "Side profile view of the same red BMW, same parking lot, same lighting"
✅ "Aerial view from above of the same office building, same urban setting" 
✅ "Back view of the same black iPhone, same white background"
✅ "Profile view of the same person, same dramatic lighting"
```

### **❌ Avoid Vague Prompts:**
```
❌ "Different angle of the car"
❌ "Another view" 
❌ "Change the perspective"
❌ "Make it from the side"
```

## 🖼️ **Reference Image Requirements**

### **✅ PERFECT Reference Images:**
- **Sharp focus** (no blur/motion)
- **Good lighting** (not too dark/bright)
- **512x512+** resolution
- **Consistent style** across all images
- **Same subject** in all images

### **❌ AVOID These:**
- Blurry/out-of-focus images
- Mixed lighting types
- Very different photo quality
- Different subjects/variations
- Heavy compression artifacts
