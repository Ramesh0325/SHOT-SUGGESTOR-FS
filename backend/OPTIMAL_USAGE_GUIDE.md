## üìù **Prompt Writing Best Practices**

### **1. üéØ Use Specific Viewpoint Terms**

#### **‚úÖ GOOD Prompts:**
```
"side view of the same car"
"rear view from behind"
"top view from above looking down"
"close-up detail of the front bumper"
"bird's eye view of the same building"
"profile view of the same person"
"ground level shot looking up"
"macro detail of the same object"
```

#### **‚ùå AVOID Vague Prompts:**
```
"different angle"          ‚Üí Too vague
"another view"            ‚Üí No specific direction
"change it"               ‚Üí No clear instruction
"make it better"          ‚Üí Ambiguous request
"new perspective"         ‚Üí Too general
```

### **2. üîÑ Specify What to Preserve**

#### **‚úÖ GOOD Preservation Terms:**
```
"same red car from the side"
"identical blue dress but profile view"
"same lighting but from above"
"same forest scene from ground level"
"same modern building from aerial view"
"same person with identical outfit, rear view"
```

#### **Key Preservation Words:**
- `same` / `identical` / `exact`
- `matching colors` / `consistent style`
- `preserve lighting` / `maintain mood`
- `keep all objects` / `same environment`

### **3. üìê Use Directional Language**

#### **Horizontal Directions:**
```
"from the left side"
"from the right side" 
"facing left"
"facing right"
"profile view"
```

#### **Vertical Directions:**
```
"from above" / "overhead view"
"from below" / "looking up"
"eye level" / "at ground level"
"elevated perspective"
"low angle shot"
```

#### **Depth Directions:**
```
"from behind" / "rear view"
"from the front" / "frontal view"
"approaching view"
"receding view"
```

### **4. üîç Specify Detail Level**

#### **Close-up Prompts:**
```
"close-up of the car's front grille"
"macro detail of the flower petals"
"detailed view of the watch face"
"zoom in on the building's entrance"
```

#### **Wide Shot Prompts:**
```
"wide shot showing the full car"
"complete building in the frame"
"full body view of the same person"
"entire scene from further back"
```

### **5. üì∑ Use Photography Terms**

#### **Professional Terms:**
```
"cinematic low angle shot"
"dramatic overhead perspective"
"architectural photography angle"
"portrait photography style"
"documentary perspective"
"commercial product shot"
```

## üîß **Mode Selection Guide**

### **When to Use Theme Preserve:**

#### **‚úÖ Choose Theme Preserve For:**
```
‚Ä¢ Artistic/creative photography
‚Ä¢ Single high-quality reference image  
‚Ä¢ Style and mood preservation priority
‚Ä¢ Creative scene expansion
‚Ä¢ Portrait photography with specific lighting
‚Ä¢ Landscape/atmospheric scenes
```

#### **Example Scenarios:**
```
"Same mystical forest atmosphere but from ground level"
"Same dramatic portrait lighting but profile view"
"Same sunset mood but from hilltop perspective"
"Same vintage style but different composition"
```

### **When to Use Multi-View Fusion:**

#### **‚úÖ Choose Multi-View Fusion For:**
```
‚Ä¢ Product photography (different angles)
‚Ä¢ Vehicle documentation  
‚Ä¢ Architecture documentation
‚Ä¢ Technical/commercial photography
‚Ä¢ When you have 2+ reference angles
‚Ä¢ Object accuracy is priority
```

#### **Example Scenarios:**
```
"Side view of the same red BMW"
"Aerial view of the same office building"
"Back view of the same smartphone"
"Rear perspective of the same person"
```

## üìä **Parameter Recommendations**

### **For Different Prompt Types:**

#### **Subtle Changes (strength: 0.4-0.5):**
```
"same scene with slightly different lighting"
"same portrait but softer expression"
"same car but cleaner/shinier"
```

#### **Moderate Changes (strength: 0.5-0.65):**
```
"same car from side view"
"same building from street level"
"same person but profile view"
```

#### **Significant Changes (strength: 0.65-0.75):**
```
"same car from dramatically low angle"
"same building from aerial helicopter view"
"same object macro detail shot"
```

## üß™ **Testing Your Setup**

### **Quick Quality Check:**
1. **Upload your reference image(s)**
2. **Try a simple test prompt**: "same [object] from side view"
3. **Check if the result**:
   - Shows the requested viewpoint ‚úÖ
   - Preserves colors and style ‚úÖ
   - Maintains object identity ‚úÖ

### **If Results Aren't Good:**

#### **Common Issues & Solutions:**
```
üîç ISSUE: Output too similar to reference
üí° SOLUTION: Increase strength to 0.6-0.7, use more specific viewpoint terms

üîç ISSUE: Output doesn't preserve theme
üí° SOLUTION: Use Theme Preserve mode, add "same style, same colors" to prompt

üîç ISSUE: Object changes too much
üí° SOLUTION: Use Multi-View Fusion mode, lower strength to 0.5

üîç ISSUE: Poor quality/artifacts
üí° SOLUTION: Use higher quality reference images, increase inference steps
```

---

## üí° **Pro Tips for Optimal Results**

### **1. Progressive Refinement:**
```
Start simple: "side view of the same car"
If good: Add details: "side profile view showing the wheels clearly"
If needed: Add style: "side view, professional automotive photography"
```

### **2. Reference Image Strategy:**
```
Single image: Use Theme Preserve, focus on style preservation
2-3 images: Use Multi-View Fusion, ensure same subject
4+ images: Excellent for Multi-View, check consistency
```

### **3. Prompt Structure Template:**
```
[VIEWPOINT] + [SAME SUBJECT] + [STYLE PRESERVATION] + [DETAILS]

Example:
"Side view" + "of the same red car" + "same lighting and background" + "showing the door and wheel clearly"
```

### **4. Quality Validation:**
```
Before submitting:
‚úì Are reference images sharp and well-lit?
‚úì Is the prompt specific about viewpoint?
‚úì Are preservation terms included?
‚úì Is the right mode selected?
```
