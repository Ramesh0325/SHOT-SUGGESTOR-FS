# Enhanced Image Fusion - Theme Preservation Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the image fusion system to better preserve reference image themes while generating new angles/viewpoints.

## üéØ Core Problem Addressed
**Original Issue**: The image fusion output was not adequately matching the reference image theme when generating from different angles.

**Goal**: Generate images that preserve the complete visual theme, style, lighting, colors, and objects from reference images while only changing the camera angle or viewpoint.

## üîß Key Improvements Made

### 1. **Enhanced Reference Image Analysis**
**Function**: `analyze_reference_images()`
- **Color Analysis**: Extracts dominant colors and color harmonies
- **Lighting Analysis**: Determines brightness levels and contrast
- **Composition Analysis**: Uses edge detection to understand visual complexity
- **Theme Detection**: Identifies warm/cool themes, detailed/minimal settings
- **Mood Assessment**: Classifies overall mood (bright/dark/balanced)

### 2. **Intelligent Image Blending**
**Improvement**: Smart structural similarity-based blending
- **Before**: Simple weighted averaging that could dilute themes
- **After**: Edge-based similarity analysis before blending
- **Benefit**: Only blends images with similar structures, preserves primary theme

```python
# Only blend if structural similarity > 10%
edge_similarity = np.sum(primary_edges & blend_edges) / np.sum(primary_edges | blend_edges + 1e-6)
if edge_similarity > 0.1:
    # Safe to blend without theme dilution
```

### 3. **Analysis-Driven Prompt Enhancement**
**Dynamic Prompt Building**: Based on reference image analysis
- Automatically adds theme-specific preservation terms
- Adapts to lighting conditions (bright/dark/balanced)
- Preserves visual style (detailed/minimal/balanced)
- Includes mood-specific terms

```python
# Example enhanced prompt:
"same scene from low angle, same bright and airy mood, same high_contrast lighting, 
same detailed and complex style, identical theme, identical visual style..."
```

### 4. **Optimized Generation Parameters**
**Conservative Settings for Better Preservation**:
- **Strength**: Reduced to 0.4 (was 0.55) - preserves more reference detail
- **Guidance Scale**: Increased to 15.0 (was 13.0) - stronger prompt following
- **Inference Steps**: Increased to 100 (was 90) - better quality

### 5. **Analysis-Based Negative Prompts**
**Intelligent Negative Terms**: Adapts to reference image characteristics
- Bright themes: Avoid "dark, gloomy, dim lighting"
- Dark themes: Avoid "bright, overexposed, cheerful"
- Detailed styles: Avoid "minimal, simple, empty"
- Minimal styles: Avoid "cluttered, busy, complex"

### 6. **Enhanced API Endpoint**
**Stronger Theme Preservation Language**:
```python
enhanced_prompt = f"{prompt}, exact same world, exact same scene, exact same objects, 
exact same props, exact same lighting conditions, exact same visual style, 
exact same color palette, exact same environment, exact same setting, 
preserve all visual elements completely, only change the camera angle or viewpoint, 
maintain all original details"
```

## üìä Parameter Guidelines

### Strength Values (0.0 - 1.0)
- **0.2 - 0.4**: Maximum theme preservation (recommended for exact theme matching)
- **0.4 - 0.6**: Balanced preservation with some creativity
- **0.6 - 0.8**: More creative interpretation, less preservation

### Guidance Scale (1.0 - 20.0)
- **12.0 - 15.0**: Strong theme following (recommended)
- **15.0 - 18.0**: Very strong theme following
- **18.0+**: Maximum adherence to prompts

### Inference Steps (20 - 150)
- **70 - 100**: Good quality (recommended)
- **100 - 120**: High quality
- **120+**: Maximum quality (slower)

## üß™ Testing the Improvements

### Run the Test Script
```bash
cd backend
python test_improved_fusion.py
```

### Manual Testing via API
```python
import requests

# Login
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/token", data={
    "username": "your_username", 
    "password": "your_password"
})
token = response.json()["access_token"]
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Test theme preservation
with open("reference1.jpg", "rb") as f1, open("reference2.jpg", "rb") as f2:
    files = [("files", f1), ("files", f2)]
    data = {
        "prompt": "same scene from a low angle",
        "strength": 0.4,           # Conservative preservation
        "guidance_scale": 15.0,    # Strong guidance
        "num_inference_steps": 100 # High quality
    }
    
    result = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:8000/api/theme-preserve",
        data=data, files=files, headers=headers
    )
```

## üéØ Expected Results

### Better Theme Preservation
- **Colors**: Should match reference image color palette exactly
- **Lighting**: Should maintain the same lighting mood and quality
- **Objects**: All props and objects should be preserved
- **Style**: Visual complexity and artistic style should remain consistent
- **Environment**: Setting and background should be identical

### Angle/Viewpoint Changes
- **Camera Position**: New angle as requested in prompt
- **Perspective**: Different viewpoint (low/high/side/behind)
- **Framing**: May show different parts or details
- **Composition**: New arrangement while keeping same elements

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Theme Is Still Not Preserved Well:
1. **Lower the strength** (try 0.3 or 0.25)
2. **Increase guidance scale** (try 16.0 or 18.0)
3. **Use more specific prompts** ("exact same lighting", "identical colors")
4. **Check reference image quality** (clear, well-lit images work better)

### If Output Is Too Similar to Reference:
1. **Slightly increase strength** (try 0.5)
2. **Use more descriptive angle prompts** ("dramatic low angle", "bird's eye view")
3. **Add specific viewpoint terms** ("from behind", "side profile")

### If Generation Is Too Slow:
1. **Reduce inference steps** (try 70-80)
2. **Check GPU availability** (CUDA should be used if available)
3. **Reduce image resolution** (reference images are resized to 512x512)

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Example 1: Portrait from Different Angle
```
Prompt: "same person from profile view"
Reference: Front-facing portrait
Expected: Side profile with same lighting, background, clothing
```

### Example 2: Scene from Low Angle
```
Prompt: "same scene from ground level looking up"
Reference: Eye-level view of a room
Expected: Low angle view showing ceiling, same furniture/decor
```

### Example 3: Object Detail Shot
```
Prompt: "close-up of same objects"
Reference: Wide shot of objects on table
Expected: Detailed view of objects, same lighting/colors
```

## üìù Notes

- The system now automatically analyzes reference images to understand their characteristics
- Blending multiple reference images is more intelligent and preserves the primary theme
- Default parameters are now optimized for theme preservation over creativity
- The system adapts its approach based on the visual characteristics it detects

This enhanced system should provide significantly better theme preservation while still allowing for creative angle changes as requested by users.
